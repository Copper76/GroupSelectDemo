- [x] Highlight objects that are selected with red, they are turned back to white when the next selection is made.

## Controls
- Mouse to drag and select objects within the scene

## Special Note
The only type of object recognised are the balls at the moment. On selection, they turn red. You could place more of them in the world. The selector could recognise any object that is tagged "Selectable". However, the demo could crash if the target object doesn't have static mesh component like the balls.
